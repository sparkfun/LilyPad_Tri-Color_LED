[*SparkFun LilyPad RGB LED (DEV-13735)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13735)

Use the LilyPad RGB LED board as a simple indicator, or by pulsing the red, green, and blue channels, you can create any color. 
This is a common cathode design - to turn on a channel you simply need to connect each R/G/B pins to a power source in order to illuminate that channel.

_Note: The original product name was called "LilyPad Tri-Color LED." V2.0 was renamed as the "LilyPad RGB LED."_
